# Project 2: Question application

Write the documentation of your project here. Do not include your personal
details (e.g. name or student number).

Remember to include the address of the online location where your project is
running as it is a key part of the submission.

This project provides you with a multiple choice questions application.
The application consists of 4 main parts: topics, questions, question answer options and the quiz
-Admin can create and remove whole topics.
-Questions on each topic can be created and removed by anyone and you can create as many as you want.
-Answer options can also be created and removed by anyone. You can add answer options to each question as many as you like but on this project, it is assumed that only one of the answers is correct in the quiz.
-You can test your knowledge via the Quiz and use it for example to study for upcoming exams in school.

All users who want to see the topics, questions etc. and play the quiz, need to create an account. This can easily be done by registering and for future use you can log in afterwards as well and continue learning!

I've used the paperCSS framework as I find it visually appealing and easy to use.

The project canbe run locally by simply by using docker-compose up. This launches the project 
on port 7777 and can then be used easily.

Unfortunately due to the credit card problem in fly.io, I am not able to deploy this project online.
